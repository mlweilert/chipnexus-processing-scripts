# qvalue cutoff = 1.00e-02
# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is off
# Paired-End mode is off

# tag size is determined as 0 bps
# total tags in treatment: 1459
# Sequencing ends will be shifted towards 5' by 75 bp(s)
# d = 150
